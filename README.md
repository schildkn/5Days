### Abstract

Death still is a very difficult topic to address in
general or to clarify what affected people are going through. This
paper presents 5Days, it’s development approach and techniques.
5Days is a game related approach to advance towards the death
topic. For this purpose an immersive virtual reality game was
developed in which the player has to go through five different
levels, which are strongly related to the five stages of grief by
K¨ubler-Ross. The death topic is unobtrusive twisted into the
games content so that the fun is maintained. The game deals
with the death topic and brings closer what affected people have
to go through based on the five stages of grief. To measure the
effect of the game on people, nine tester where asked about
different game qualities after they played the game. The results
show that the topic could arouse attention without loosing the
fun of playing. With this 5Days is a game which is fun to play
but could as well be a new entry point into death education.
